== Nagios Plugin JBossAS7 ==

This project provides a Nagios plugin for JBossAS 7.1.1 resource monitoring. The plugin uses HTTP-JSON based API (JBossAS REST Management API) to collect server statistics. The plugin currently supports JBoss standalone mode.

Other plugins need additional +SAR+ or +WAR+ to be installed on the application server. Typically in Enterprise setups; it is sometimes not allowed to perform any additional installations on the target system.
The main advantage of this plugin is it leverages the +REST+ API of JBossAS. This allows us to monitor the application server without any additional configurations and installations.

=== Requirements: ===
* Nagios
* Python 2.7 onwards (with +requests+ module used for digest authentication)
* JBossAS 7.1.1-Final

=== Usage: ===

The check script supports following options. Details about monitoring different resources is available in respective sub-sections.

There is also some examples of using this plugin as an check_mk MRPE plugin in the link:check_mk.example folder.

Currently the plugin supports monitoring of following resources and sub-systems.
